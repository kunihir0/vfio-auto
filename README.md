# run-vfio.py // connecting worlds...  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î

Present day, present time.

Are you connected? To the other side? This little script helps bridge the gap... connect your GPU from *this* layer (your host system) to *another* layer (a virtual machine). For games, maybe? Or other experiments... ‚ú®

## // What This Signal Does

*   Checks your system's potential (IOMMU, CPU Virtualization). üíª
*   Configures the pathways (`vfio` kernel modules). üîß
*   Adjusts the boot sequence (GRUB, systemd-boot, Pop!_OS kernelstub). ‚öôÔ∏è
*   Binds your GPU to the VFIO protocol for clean transmission. üîÑ
*   Validates IOMMU groups for proper device isolation. üß©
*   Generates a way back (`vfio_cleanup.sh`) if you get lost. ‚Ü©Ô∏è
*   Creates system snapshots on BTRFS filesystems for safety. üì∏
*   Verifies your connection after reboot with repair options. ‚úÖ
*   Warns about Secure Boot interference.

## // Protocol Requirements

*   `sudo` / root access (Admin Level Connection).
*   Python 3.6+ (Wired Language Interface v3.6 or higher).
*   Hardware Compatibility (At least two GPUs - one to stay in this layer, one to transmit).
*   IOMMU-capable motherboard with CPU virtualization enabled (Layer Separation Technology).
*   Supported bootloader (GRUB, systemd-boot, Pop!_OS kernelstub).

## // Initiate Connection

It's simple. Just... reach out.

```bash
sudo ./run-vfio.py
```

## // Connection Parameters

*   `--dry-run` ‚û°Ô∏è Simulate the connection. No real changes made. Safe~ ‚òÜ
*   `--cleanup` ‚û°Ô∏è Disconnect. Runs the generated vfio_cleanup.sh if it exists.
*   `--debug` ‚û°Ô∏è Show all the hidden signals. Can be noisy. üì°
*   `--verify` ‚û°Ô∏è Check if your system is properly configured after reboot. üîç
*   `--verify-auto` ‚û°Ô∏è Interactive verification with automated repair options. üõ†Ô∏è
*   `--non-interactive` ‚û°Ô∏è Assume "yes" to all prompts. For automated scripts. ü§ñ
*   `--output-dir PATH` ‚û°Ô∏è Custom directory for generated files. üìÅ
*   `--help` ‚û°Ô∏è Show all possible connection parameters. üí¨

## // Signal Interference ‚ö†Ô∏è

Modifying system connections can be strange. Unexpected results may occur. This script tries to be careful (backups, cleanup script), but the Wired is complex. Use --dry-run first. Understand what you are doing.

Secure Boot can disrupt the connection. Virtualization must be enabled in BIOS/UEFI. Poor IOMMU grouping may require unsafe ACS override patches. Sometimes, layer separation isn't clean.

## // Protocol Architecture

The signal is modular:
*   `vfio_configurator/` ‚û°Ô∏è The main transmission protocol modules
*   `pci.py` ‚û°Ô∏è Discovers devices and their IOMMU groupings
*   `reporting.py` ‚û°Ô∏è Creates visual signals about your system status
*   `bootloader.py` ‚û°Ô∏è Configures your system's initialization sequence
*   `initramfs.py` ‚û°Ô∏è Updates your system's boot image with required modules
*   `vfio_mods.py` ‚û°Ô∏è Handles VFIO driver configuration
*   `checks.py` ‚û°Ô∏è Verifies system compatibility and requirements
*   `snapshot.py` ‚û°Ô∏è Creates BTRFS snapshots for recovery
*   `state.py` ‚û°Ô∏è Tracks changes and generates cleanup script

...No matter where you go, everyone's connected.

## // Distribution Support

The protocol attempts to adapt to various layers of reality:
*   Debian-based (Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, elementary OS)
*   Arch-based (Manjaro, EndeavourOS, Garuda)
*   Fedora-based (RHEL, CentOS, Rocky, AlmaLinux)
*   openSUSE / SUSE

Each realm has unique pathways, but the signal tries to find its way through.
